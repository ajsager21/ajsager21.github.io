Hello! My name is Andrew (A.J.) Sager and I am orginally from San Diego, California. I am a current MSBA candidate at the UC Irvine Paul Merage School of Business. I completed my undergraduate degree at UC Irvine as well and majored in Quantitative Economics. Throughout my time at UC Irvine, I was also on the Division 1 Track and Field and Cross Country teams. I am passionate about data, sports, and environmental sustainability-all of which are interests and passions that are reflected within my portfolio. In my free time when I am not solving data problems or running, you might find me enjoying the outdoors through fishing, golfing, or hiking. I am also somewhat of a coffee connoisseur and am constantly on the search for the best cup of coffee in Irvine and San Diego.
